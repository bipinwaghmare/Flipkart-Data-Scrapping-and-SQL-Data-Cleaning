## **Flipkart Smartphone Data Scraping Project** ðŸ“Š

### **Overview**
This project scrapes smartphone product data from Flipkart's website using the **BeautifulSoup** library. The data includes product specifications such as **price, storage, display size, camera details, battery, processor, rating**, and more. The scraped data is saved into a CSV file for further analysis.

Currently, the dataset contains **900+ rows** of smartphone data, and more data will be added with subsequent scrapes.
