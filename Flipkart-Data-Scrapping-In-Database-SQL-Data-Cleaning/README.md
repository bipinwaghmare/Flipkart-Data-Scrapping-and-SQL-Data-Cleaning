# Flipkart Mobile Data Scraping and Cleaning

## Project Overview

This project involves scraping mobile phone data from **Flipkart**, storing the scraped data directly into an **SQL database**, and performing **data cleaning** using **SQL queries**. The cleaned data is then ready for further analysis or visualization.

### Key Features:
- **Web Scraping**: Utilizes `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to scrape product data, including names, prices, specifications, and reviews.
- **SQL Integration**: Directly stores scraped data into an SQL database.
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and processes the data using efficient SQL queries to ensure consistency and readiness for analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data scraping
  - `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content.
  - `requests` for making HTTP requests.
- **SQL**: For data storage and cleaning.
- **MySQL Connector**: For connecting Python to the SQL database.
- **Pandas**: Used within the script for temporary data manipulation (optional).

## Steps to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python and MySQL on your system.
2. Install required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, ensure you install `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`, and `mysql-connector-python`.)*

3. Set up a MySQL database and update connection credentials in `main.py`.

### Step 1: Scraping and Storing Data

1. Run the `main.py` script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. This script will:
   - Scrape mobile phone data from Flipkart.
   - Store the raw data directly into the specified SQL database.

---

### Step 2: Data Cleaning Using SQL

1. Open the `scrapped_querry.sql` file in your SQL client or editor.
2. Execute the queries step by step to clean and process the raw data.
3. The cleaned data will be updated directly in the SQL database.

---

## Output

- **Raw Data**: Scraped and stored in SQL without preprocessing.
- **Cleaned Data**: Processed and ready for analysis, stored in SQL after executing the queries.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Automate the data cleaning process directly within the Python script using SQL queries.
- Add data visualization dashboards for the cleaned data.
